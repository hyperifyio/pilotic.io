The backlog is the central repository for all planned work, aggregating our epics, user stories, and tasks into one prioritized list. It serves as the single source of truth for project requirements and future development, ensuring that every item aligns with our strategic objectives and can be continuously refined as priorities evolve.

----

<a name="168"></a>
# Epic 168 - Caching and Synchronization

The system improves performance by storing issue data temporarily, reducing the need for frequent GitHub API calls. This makes issue tracking faster and more efficient while staying within GitHub’s usage limits. It also keeps local issue data in sync with GitHub, ensuring that any changes made are updated automatically. The main repository and tracking ticket are configured in the system settings, keeping everything organized without needing manual setup in the UI.

# Story 180 - GitHub Ticket Integration Configuration for Issue Tracking  

### Description  

As an admin, I want to configure GitHub credentials, the main repository and ticket so that I can define the scope of issue tracking.  

This feature allows users to specify which GitHub repository the issue management platform should track. Additionally, users can select a primary ticket (e.g., the root ticket for the whole project) under which all issues will be organized. This ensures that issue tracking is scoped correctly and remains manageable within the platform.  

### Goal  

- Allow the admin to select a GitHub repository to use for issue tracking.  
- Enable configuration of a root ticket under which all issues will be structured.  
- Ensure that changes to the selected repository or root ticket are stored persistently.  

### Acceptance Criteria  

- [ ] Admin can define GitHub credentials for integration in the configuration.  
- [ ] Admin can input/select a GitHub repository to track issues from.  
- [ ] Admin can define a main ticket that serves as the root for issue hierarchy.

# Story 163 - User Access Management for Issue Tracking

### Description  

As a Project Owner, I want to manage user access levels so that I can control who can edit or view project issues.  

This feature allows the Project Owner to define access permissions for different users within the issue management platform. By configuring access levels, the Project Owner can ensure that only authorized users can modify issues while allowing others to view progress without making changes.  

### Goal  

- Allow the Project Owner to assign roles and access levels to users.  
- Restrict issue editing to authorized users while maintaining read access for others.  
- Ensure that user permissions persist and are enforced within the platform.  

### Acceptance Criteria  

- [ ] Users with appropriate permissions can edit issues.  
- [ ] Users without edit access can view issues but cannot make changes.  
- [ ] The Project Owner can update user roles and access levels.  
- [ ] Unauthorized users attempting to modify issues receive an appropriate error message.  

### Requirements

# Epic 171 - Modular Design and Extensibility

The system is built with a flexible architecture that allows new features and integrations to be added easily. It follows a modular design where different parts of the system work independently but can be extended or replaced when needed. This makes it possible to switch to another issue tracking backend in the future without major changes. The approach ensures long-term scalability and adaptability as project needs evolve.

# Story 282 - Modular System Architecture for Future Frontend Extensibility

### Description  

As a Technical Lead, I want the frontend to be modular so that the team can extend it with custom integrations in the future.  

This feature ensures that **the frontend** is designed with a modular architecture, allowing new functionalities and integrations to be added without significant refactoring. Modules should follow well-defined interfaces to ensure compatibility and maintainability.  

### Goal  

- Implement a modular architecture that supports extensibility.  
- Define clear interfaces for integrations to ensure consistency.  
- Allow teams to add or modify modules without affecting core functionality.  

### Acceptance Criteria  

- [ ] The system follows a modular design, separating core functionality from extensions.  
- [ ] Modules can be independently developed and integrated without modifying core components.  
- [ ] A standard interface is provided for adding custom integrations.  
- [ ] Configuration management supports enabling or disabling modules dynamically.  
- [ ] Documentation exists to guide developers on extending the system with new modules.

# Epic 290 - Implement Issue Exporting Functionality

This epic introduces the ability to export issues from our Issue Manager in various formats. The solution must align with the existing modular architecture—especially the abstraction layer that hides GitHub-specific details behind interfaces—so that exporting remains backend-agnostic and can be extended to other services (e.g., JIRA, Azure DevOps) in the future.

# Story 291 - Export Full Ticket Hierarchy as Markdown

As a user, I want to export all tickets (including sub-tickets and nested references) in a single Markdown file so I can easily read, share, or archive the complete issue hierarchy in a well-structured, text-based format.

### Acceptance Criteria

  1. [x] The export should include each ticket’s title, description, and metadata.
  2. [x] Cross-references and links between tickets are preserved or embedded, allowing easy navigation in Markdown viewers.
  3. [x] Large hierarchies (many nested levels) export without performance issues or truncated data.
  4. [x] The resulting `.md` file is ready for offline use, documentation, or further processing in a Markdown-compatible system.
