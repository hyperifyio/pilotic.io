This feature ensures that any modifications made locally are periodically synchronized with GitHub, keeping issue states up to date. The system should handle bidirectional synchronization, ensuring that local updates are pushed to GitHub and remote changes are fetched to keep the local state consistent.  

### Goal  

- Automatically sync local issue state with GitHub without manual intervention.  
- Ensure bidirectional synchronization to reflect both local and remote updates.  
- Prevent conflicts when multiple users update issues.  

### Acceptance Criteria  

- [ ] The system detects local issue modifications and syncs them to GitHub.  
- [x] The system fetches updates from GitHub to refresh the local state.  
- [ ] Synchronization runs automatically at a configurable interval.  
- [x] Users can manually trigger a sync if needed.  
- [ ] Conflict resolution is handled gracefully when an issue has been modified both locally and remotely.  
- [ ] Proper error handling and retry mechanisms are in place for failed sync attempts.  

### Requirements
- [ ] [Requirement 175 - Data synchronization should use batch updates where possible to improve efficiency.](#175)
- [ ] [Requirement 27 - Maintain a consistent internal data model for easy future upgrades](#27)

# Epic 162 - Authentication and Authorization

The system allows users to log in securely and control who can access project issues. It uses OAuth for authentication, so users can sign in without creating new accounts. Role-based access ensures only the right people can view or edit issues. The system keeps track of login activity for security and future auditing. While it works with GitHub, it is designed to support other services if needed.

# Story 163 - User Access Management for Issue Tracking

### Description  

As a Project Owner, I want to manage user access levels so that I can control who can edit or view project issues.  

This feature allows the Project Owner to define access permissions for different users within the issue management platform. By configuring access levels, the Project Owner can ensure that only authorized users can modify issues while allowing others to view progress without making changes.  

### Goal  

- Allow the Project Owner to assign roles and access levels to users.  
- Restrict issue editing to authorized users while maintaining read access for others.  
- Ensure that user permissions persist and are enforced within the platform.  

### Acceptance Criteria  

- [ ] Users with appropriate permissions can edit issues.  
- [ ] Users without edit access can view issues but cannot make changes.  
- [ ] The Project Owner can update user roles and access levels.  
- [ ] Unauthorized users attempting to modify issues receive an appropriate error message.

# Story 164 - User Authentication via GitHub OAuth

### Description

As a **Solo Developer**, I want to log in using my GitHub credentials so that I can securely access my issue management platform.  

### Goal

The system should integrate with GitHub OAuth to provide seamless authentication while ensuring security and session management. Upon successful login, the system should retrieve the user’s basic GitHub profile information and establish a session for subsequent interactions with the platform.  

This feature will allow authenticated users to access their projects, manage issues, and interact with the system while maintaining security and preventing unauthorized access. 

### Acceptance Criteria  

- [ ] Users can log in using their GitHub credentials via OAuth.  
- [ ] Upon successful login, the system retrieves and stores the user's GitHub ID, username, and email (if available).  
- [ ] The authentication session persists until the user logs out or the session expires.  
- [ ] Secure token storage and session management are implemented to prevent unauthorized access.  
- [ ] Users attempting to access the platform without authentication are redirected to the login page.  
- [ ] Proper error handling is in place for failed authentication attempts, such as invalid credentials or API failures.

### Description  

Set up the configuration structure for GitHub OAuth authentication, ensuring secure storage, adherence to the interface-driven architecture, and proper dependency injection into the authentication service.  

### Acceptance Criteria  

- [ ] Define an `IGitHubOAuthConfig` interface to standardize configuration properties.  
- [ ] Implement a concrete `GitHubOAuthConfig` class that retrieves values from `appsettings.json` or environment variables.  
- [ ] Ensure the configuration includes `Client ID`, `Client Secret`, `Authorization URL`, `Token URL`, and `Redirect URI`.  
- [ ] Store sensitive credentials securely using environment variables or a secure secrets manager.  
- [ ] Register `GitHubOAuthConfig` as a singleton in the dependency injection container.  
- [ ] Inject `IGitHubOAuthConfig` into `GitHubAuthenticationService` instead of directly accessing configuration values.  
- [ ] Validate the presence of required configuration values at application startup and log meaningful errors if misconfigured.

# Story 265 - Email-Based Single Sign-On (SSO) Authentication

### Description  
As a Solo Developer, I want to log in using a one-time code sent to my email so that I can securely access my issue management platform without needing a password.  

This feature allows users to authenticate by entering their email, receiving a secure sign-in code, and using it to access the platform. It provides a simple, secure, and passwordless authentication method, reducing the need to remember credentials while ensuring strong access control.  

### Goal  
- Implement a passwordless login system using email-based single sign-on (SSO).  
- Ensure that login codes are secure, time-limited, and one-time use only.  
- Provide a seamless authentication experience with session management.  

### Acceptance Criteria  
- [ ] Users can enter their email to request a one-time login code.  
- [ ] The system generates a secure, time-limited, single-use authentication code.  
- [ ] Users can log in by entering the received code within the allowed time frame.  
- [ ] The authentication session persists until the user logs out or the session expires.  
- [ ] Secure storage and validation mechanisms are implemented to prevent code reuse or brute force attacks.  
- [ ] Users attempting to access the platform without authentication are redirected to the login page.  
- [ ] Proper error handling is in place for expired, invalid, or incorrect authentication codes.

# Story 167 - Expandable and Collapsible Issue Branches for Efficient Backlog Navigation

### Description  

As a Scrum Master, I want to expand or collapse issue branches in the UI so that I can navigate the backlog efficiently.  

This feature allows users to control the visibility of issue hierarchies, making it easier to focus on specific tasks while maintaining an overview of the project. By expanding and collapsing branches, users can quickly drill down into details or simplify the view as needed.  

### Goal  

- Provide an intuitive UI for expanding and collapsing issue hierarchies.  
- Allow users to toggle visibility of child issues under parent tasks.  
- Improve backlog navigation efficiency by reducing visual clutter.  

### Acceptance Criteria
